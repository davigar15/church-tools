8:6 But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon better promises.

8:7 For if that first covenant had been faultless, then should no place have been found for the second.

8:8 For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah.

8:9 Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they continued not in my covenant, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord.

These verses were what we preached on last Sunday. And we saw in verse 6 that we are told that God has instituted a better covenant than the former, because it is established on better promises; and that the ministry of our Lord (as High Priest and Mediator of that better covenant) is also superior to that of the former Levitical priests.

But before developing this main theme which Hebrews 8 presents to us (namely, to see what the characteristics of those better promises are that make the new covenant a better covenant — something we will consider today), last Sunday we attempted to ascertain the reasons why the former failed; for if the old covenant could have delivered us from the problem we humans have of breaking the law, there would have been no need for God to enact a newer, better covenant. Why did it fail?

“For they did not continue in my covenant, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord” (Hebrews 8:9). In this verse 9 lies the key to the failure of the old covenant: because they did not continue in my covenant. For a covenant rests on both parties keeping the agreement, and if one party fails, the whole agreement is void. So from the moment Israel ceased to keep its promises, God was no longer obliged to keep His, though He endured with patience for centuries and gave many warnings prior to declaring it void.

Yet the old covenant itself had no defect in itself (the problem of the old covenant did not reside in the covenant, nor in the law it rested upon) — the problem lies in the deficiency that we humans have to keep it.

Conclusion: The priesthood of Jesus is clearly superior. 1) because He is the representative of a better covenant, 2) because His ministry is grounded on better promises. But what are those better promises and what characteristics do they have? (vv. 10–13)

8:10 For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord: I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts; and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people.

8:11 And they shall not teach every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest.

8:12 For I will be merciful to their iniquities, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.

8:13 In that he saith, A new covenant, he hath made the first old. Now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away.

The title of the preaching is:

ALL THINGS ARE FORGOTTEN
Our sins have already been punished
(Hebrews 8:10–13)

The author of this Letter, in the mouth of the prophet Jeremiah, tells us: This is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel… and then indicates the clauses and conditions of the new covenant that God would make with His people in those days, days that came with the Messiah.

This is the theme: to understand what the new relationship is that God has with His people through the new covenant that He makes with them. This is the theme, and I will set it forth through the following outline:
The new covenant: Purpose (vv. 10–12).
The new covenant: Clauses (vv. 10–12).
The new covenant: More than new (v. 13).
Practical applications.

I. The new covenant: Purpose
8:10 For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord: I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts; and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people;

8:11 And they shall not teach every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest.

8:12 For I will be merciful to their iniquities, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.

With this new covenant God will give a definitive solution to the calamity of human sin, resolving once and for all the problem of our disobedience. God offers us a new way of relating to Him, through a covenant essentially consisting of three clauses:
- He will implant His law in our hearts.
- We will have a distinct relationship with God, whose two main features are: the ability to enter into His presence to have personal fellowship with Him, and a knowledge of God that is more practical and personal, not merely theoretical.
- He will completely blot out the memory of our sins.

What this means is that, through His Spirit,
- His law will be written in our hearts.
- He will enable us to enter into His presence to have fellowship with Him and thus know Him in a more personal way.
- And through the work of His Son on the cross, the propitiation of our sins will not be symbolic, partial, or temporary, but we will have the definitive forgiveness of our sins.

The new covenant is with the house of Israel, but last Sunday I showed through various NT passages that we are the new Israel of God. For there are not two separate covenants, one a continuation of the other, so that there is a direct link between the old and the new, since we are the true spiritual descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
This is better understood with an illustration: imagine you have signed a contract of any kind, and after a time it becomes evident that the contract does not fulfill its purposes. There are clauses which impose conditions, but one of the parties does not enjoy the benefits that should come from the contract because it seems impossible to fulfill those conditions. Yet the party that does fulfill (in this case God) offers the offender (us, the sinful humanity) a change in the contract’s conditions so that the contract’s purpose can be satisfied for both parties.

The essence of the covenant remains the same, yet it is entirely new—completely different from the former. God makes a covenant with a chosen people. This covenant says: I am your God, and you are my people. But there is a condition for the covenant to function: obedience. None of this has changed with the new covenant. The covenant is the same. What happens is that after a time, God, the author of the covenant, makes an improvement to that covenant to solve the problem of disobedience… an improvement that makes it entirely different.

The first people with whom God made the covenant did not keep it, which is why God now extends His covenant to the rest of the world, changing the place where He seated His law. Before, the law was outside the heart of man, written in stone; now He writes it on the heart of every one of His people, transforming them in flesh, so that all the members of His people know Him. In the old covenant animals were sacrificed; in this one there is a single sacrifice (that of His Son on the cross), which fully and perfectly satisfies the justice God requires.

It is a new covenant, yes, but it is based on the same pact; what changes is that the one who perfectly fulfills it in my place is Jesus… so that the Father may completely erase all my sins. And this makes it more than new… essentially different. We will further consider the role of this sinful man (yet transformed by the Spirit) in this new covenant. But the covenant, in its foundational terms, remains the same: He is our God, and we are His people; and the condition for this covenant to work is the same: obedience. Do you see? God has not changed, and yet He has changed everything. Let us look more deeply.

II. The new covenant: Clauses
8:10 For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord: I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts; and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people;

8:11 And they shall not teach every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest.

8:12 For I will be merciful to their iniquities, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.

1. The implantation of God’s Law
8:10(b) I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts;

This is the first clause, and if you notice it does not say that the law is annulled, for it reflects the holy character of God; and as I said last Sunday, to annul it would be to annul God Himself. What it says is that the law of God will occupy a different position.

God gave the law at Mount Sinai, through a legislation written on stone tablets. It was a law external to them, which they had to memorize. Do you remember: “And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be in thy heart; and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thy house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up. And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thy hand, and they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes; and thou shalt write them on the posts of thy house, and on thy gates” (Deuteronomy 6:6–9). It was they who had to make the effort to place the law in their hearts; it was not God placing it within them.

Thus this first clause indicates that the initiative to memorize, meditate, understand, and practice His counsels and commandments no longer comes from men, but from God. And how does He accomplish this? By a miracle… transforming our heart of stone into a heart of flesh, a heart that desires to obey what it once refused to do. It is the Holy Spirit at work in our minds and hearts, so that we may understand who God is and who we are; and He also produces the change in our will. For in the new covenant, “God is the one who works in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure” (Philippians 2:13).

So in this renewed covenant we have Someone dwelling within us, Someone who has the mind of God and His own desires. In the flesh we resist doing His will (as we saw before our conversion and as we see in the unsaved). Yet, thanks to the Holy Spirit’s work, “we have the mind of Christ” (1 Corinthians 2:16).

This is the very thing Jeremiah had prophesied: “And I will give them a heart, and I will put my fear in their hearts, to be before me forever, that they may walk in my statutes, and keep my judgments, and do them” (Jeremiah 32:39–40). God loves us so much that He promises: you will obey indeed! You will not have only momentary fear and then forget Me. No.

What He will do to fix the problem of disobedience is “give you a heart… and I will put a new spirit within you. I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh, that you may walk in my statutes, keep my judgments, and do them… and you shall be my people, and I will be your God” (Ezekiel 11:19–20). In this way the Spirit will transform your thoughts, priorities, desires, and affections so that your will inclines to Mine. And I will do it, declares the Lord.

A teaching for us: Paul shows how our witness to the world should be, in light of this miracle wrought by the Spirit within us. To the Corinthians he writes that they must be “as epistles of Christ, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not on tablets of stone, but on the fleshy tables of the heart, who have been made manifest, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; for the letter killeth, but the Spirit giveth life” (2 Corinthians 3:2–3 and 6).

We are ministers of a new covenant, as letters written by God for men to read. Letters written on the heart, not with letters, but with the Spirit; for the letter killeth, but the Spirit giveth life. The true meaning of this verse (frequently misunderstood) is not that you must set aside your Bible as dead letter to live under a subjective impulse of the Spirit doing what you think He tells you to do. No, Paul is not saying that. What Paul is saying is that, because of our weakness to keep the law, it has become the finger of God that accuses us without being able to save us.

The law kills not because it is evil, for as we have said many times, “the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just and good” (Romans 7:12), but it kills in the sense that it condemns the sinner without giving him power to free himself from the dominion of sin. But now, that same law that once accused us of death for not being able to keep it and that was written outside the heart, the Spirit writes upon the hearts of believers… and He Himself works in us so that we may live it. This is what it means that the letter killeth, but the Spirit giveth life.

It is amazing what God has done with us through His new covenant. While “Aaron and all the children of Israel, when they looked toward Moses, and behold the skin of his face shone, they were afraid to come near him” (Exodus 34:30), “we all, beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord” (2 Corinthians 3:18).

And we all, because all the members of God’s people are being transformed. If there is anyone who, even gradually, is not being transformed, but takes pleasure in sin and holds to fornication or lying or murmuring, then he is not part of God’s people, for when you have the Spirit sealing your heart, you cannot be indifferent; He does not leave you. What the Spirit does with the law written on our hearts is to plant in our minds the same thoughts of Christ, and to empower our will to follow His thoughts and desires. This is a great difference from the old covenant. The difference comes from God’s grace working in us. Before, it was only human effort to keep a set of laws written outside the heart.

If you are in the new covenant of God, you know what I mean. Before we had no intention to keep God’s law; and when under social pressure we attempted to keep some of His precepts, it was a frustrating effort as we realized we could not follow the perfect example of Christ, much less persevere in Him. Now, knowing that we have been justified and that we do not need to do anything to be saved, we now have the same desire from God to do His will.

But, pastor, I do not always do His will, and certainly not perfectly. It is true that the perfect transformation our heart longs for we cannot yet accomplish in our bodies not yet redeemed, where sin dwells. But firstly: we are aware of what we were unaware of before (our spiritual misery); and secondly, precisely because of this, we know that the Spirit is at work in us. Therefore we can say that God, by His grace and His love for us, is merciful to our iniquities, and will never annul the covenant He has made with us. But we will see this in the 3rd clause.

2. A distinct relationship with God (A personal knowledge)
8:10(c) And I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people.

This is the 2nd clause, whose first characteristic is the power to enter into His presence to have personal fellowship with Him. And the first thing that strikes me is the certainty with which it states: I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people. What happened before and what happens now to make God affirm it so firmly, if this same clause was already in the old covenant? The difference is that in the old covenant there was a condition that has disappeared.

“If ye walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments, and do them… I will walk among you, and I will be your God, and ye shall be my people” (Leviticus 26:3, 12). Here we see that the condition for this 2nd clause in the old covenant was that the people of Israel had to respond by keeping the commandments and decrees of God in full. As they violated this condition, the covenant’s commitment to them was nullified. It was they who annulled the covenant.

But why in the new covenant does this condition not exist, if we have said it is a new covenant on the same base: obedience? Simply because, of this obedience, the One who accomplishes it is God Himself. There is only one requirement on our part: to accept the covenant, and even there we have nothing to do, for that is the Spirit’s work giving us life to be born again.

God takes care of this condition. On the one hand, He commits, by the power of His Spirit, to perform His work in those who believe in the saving work of His Son on the cross, so that now, by the new birth, He places in us a new heart in which He writes His law. And on the other hand, since we do not reach perfection in keeping that law, we are justified by His Son Jesus Christ (though this is part of the 3rd clause). But all is the work of God.

And “I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people.” This clause, in the new covenant, achieves a dimension of security not seen in the old. In the old covenant the security of being part of God’s people depended on fulfilling the whole law. Now the security is given by God Himself, as He fulfilled that condition in our place.

And “I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people.” This is the new birth. Without this new birth, we could not fulfill the 2nd clause, which is to have intimate communion with God. The Israelites did not have intimate communion with God as we have; they had a different relationship with Him, because their knowledge of God was also different from ours.

2. A distinct relationship with God (A personal knowledge)
8:11 And they shall not teach every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest.

We continue with the 2nd clause, since having a personal relationship with God makes our knowledge of Him different from that of the Jews in the old covenant, a knowledge that is not only theoretical but more personal.

But the hallmark of this clause of the new covenant is that this personal knowledge of God shall be possessed by all the members of His people. The old covenant was made with a nation… but not all the members of Israel knew God. Every Jew was in the covenant because the covenant was made with the physical descendants of Abraham, but not all knew the God of that covenant, which means not all were believers, as the history of Israel confirms. How many disobeyed God, openly opposed His will, or practiced idolatry! The history of the Jewish people is full of such betrayals and iniquities.

However in the new covenant, all the members of God’s people, all of them, shall be true believers. Therefore in this people (the Church) there will be no one who will say to his brother: Know the Lord! for all of them shall know Him. We may exhort a brother to follow the Lord, but we can do so only because he knows the Lord. If someone in God’s people does not know Him, he is not part of His people.

What was the knowledge of God like in the old covenant? It was a general knowledge, but there was no intimate relationship. It is true that on occasion, when the Spirit rested on a prophet or a psalmist, they had an intimate relation with God, as seen in their prophecies or the Psalms. But generally, the people had a superficial knowledge of God, a knowledge based on recalling what He had done for them in the past, learning His law, and attempting to keep it. Yet all this knowledge came from outside… through priests, Levite teachers, and prophets.

This kind of knowledge (which came from outside and lacked an intimate relationship) could be seen clearly on the Day of Atonement. On that day, even the symbolic relationship they could have, they experienced through the high priest who represented them before God once a year in the temple.

Yet in the new covenant we can enter into God’s presence personally every day, without the need of human priests, because we have a great High Priest in the heavens who gives us access to the Father’s presence.

This is something the author of Hebrews makes clear by using the verb “to know” in its two Greek senses. “And they shall not teach every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest.” The first “Know the Lord” means to know something that has been taught (for example what is taught in school); however the second “all shall know me” refers to knowledge gained by experience, or by personal dealings with someone. The first verb is didasko (to teach by discourse); the second is ginoskō (to come to know).

Teaching for us: In the old covenant the knowledge of God came by the teaching of others (priests, Levite teachers, or prophets). In the new covenant all the people of God, without exception, know God, from the least to the greatest, due to the personal relationship His people have with Him through His Word and the Spirit.

If we allow the Word to cleanse us (without justifying ourselves when it says what we do not want to hear), and if we do not grieve the Spirit (by being where we ought not be or doing what we ought not do), we will grow in a personal relationship with God that leads to greater holiness as we know Him better. For this is eternal life: that they may know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent (John 17:3).

3. The justification of the sinner
8:12 For I will be merciful to their iniquities, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.

The Spirit lifts in us a greater desire to know the Lord, more hunger and thirst for His Word, a longing to have fellowship with Him and with His people, and a greater desire to obey Him in all things… but not always. We do not always desire to know the Lord, not always hungry and thirsty for His Word, not always eager to gather and praise Him together… and we do not always do His will.

Surely, “in the inward man I delight in the law of God; but I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members” (Romans 7:22–23). What happens when I fall? For the Bible tells me I will fall. 1 John 1:8 tells me, “If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.” In that case, do I not have the Spirit?

Is it possible, as in the old covenant, that an instance of unfaithfulness would expel me from the covenant? The new covenant says no… unless we are speaking of recurrent sins that are the symptom of a problem of unbelief. Unbelief, and not any particular violation of God’s law, is what proves that we were never inside the covenant.

Therefore, what happens when, despite God writing His law on my heart and granting me the grace to be my God and I His people, granting me the privilege of fellowship with Him, I fall into disobedience? Does the covenant break with me? This 3rd clause says no. The work of Christ’s satisfaction on the cross and His priesthood in the heavens is so perfect that God affirms with clarity that He will be merciful to my iniquities, and will remember my sins and my iniquities no more. The mercy of this clause rests on the propitiation wrought on the cross… which is all-sufficient for God to wipe away completely the memory of my past, present, and future sin.

But of course God does remember, for He would cease to be omniscient otherwise; and He does not forget them as though they had never occurred, for that would be to deny His justice; what He says is that He will bring them to remembrance. What does this mean? This clause is best understood in a judicial context. What God tells us here is that when we are called to judgment, it will not be necessary to appear, because someone has already paid in our place; therefore it is improper to bring to memory deeds that have already been judged and punished. No one can judge or punish someone twice for the same offense.

And something interesting about this clause: why is it at the end rather than at the beginning? If it were placed first, it might seem that God only forgives sins committed before conversion, leaving sins committed after as witnesses to our condemnation. Jeremiah does not say, “I will forget their iniquities, and after that I will put my law in their hearts.” No. What he says is: I will first put my law in their hearts, and if they still fail, I will be merciful to their iniquities, and I will remember their sins and their iniquities no more.

This covenant does not depend on our ability to keep the law. This covenant rests on God’s saving initiative in Christ… hence it is secure, hence we can see that security in all its statements, and hence God pronounces the old one obsolete.

III. The new covenant: More than new
8:13 In that he saith, A new covenant, he hath made the first old. Now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away.

There are two things this verse teaches us. One is very evident and I will not spend much time explaining it, for it is clear simply by reading the verse: the old covenant fades away because a new one has appeared.

But there is something in this verse that can only be seen between the lines. In Greek there are several words for “new.” One is neos, which means something new but of the same kind; and another is kainos, which also means new, but of a different kind.

For example, wine can be called neos when it is from a newly produced harvest but of the same kind as the previous; or kainos when it is a wine of a different character. In short: neos is new in time; kainos is new in essential nature.

Here, the author uses the word kainos to designate the new covenant as new. In the old covenant there were two parties to the contract (God and His people), and both had duties to fulfill. But in the kainos covenant we only see the promises God makes to His people; we do not see any condition imposed on that people. So the new covenant is new not because it is new in time, but because it has something that makes it different from the old. And this has important practical applications for our life.

IV. Practical applications
Why can we know we are saved? Is it because we are very good? Because we attend church? These would be mistaken answers.

Imagine you stand at the gates of heaven, and at the entrance someone asks you why you are sure you may enter; what would you say? There is only one correct answer: Jesus saved me, He died for my sins, and He told me that He would remember them no more. I know I do not deserve it, but I also know that God has made a covenant with me, by which Jesus paid in my place what I should have paid, and what I could never pay. So there is nothing against me; I am confident that my name is written in the Book of Life, because He is faithful and He has told me so.

Yet many will be surprised when they stand before God’s throne with another attitude, insisting they did not sin so badly, that others did worse, and realizing that this was not the condition for entry—that God will not turn a blind eye when it comes to applying His justice, that His mercy should have been sought earlier… and not at judgment. That is why many fear death, because deep down they know their own justice and goodness are not as they suppose.

Another teaching is that although Jesus fulfilled perfectly the whole law in our place, that does not mean we may neglect it. In the old covenant, to remain in, you had to obey the law; in the new, since you are in, if you are truly a believer, you will want to keep it. And if you have no desire to obey His commandments, the first question you must ask yourself is whether the law is written on your heart; for if the law of God is in your heart, you will not want to commit adultery, fornication, theft, lying, or deceit. If the law is in your heart, the result will be a transformed life; if it is not, you will not feel bad when you break it (indeed you may take pleasure in doing what your own mind says and disobeying His commandments). Then you are not part of God’s people. For the law remains the same; what has changed is the location of its presence. Before, it was outside, accusing me; now, from within, it strengthens me.

Another teaching is that God is no longer angry with His people. Previously He was almost always angry with Israel because they did not do right. Therefore, if you have trouble in life, it does not necessarily mean God is angry with you, because in the new covenant God is no longer angry with His people. God allows difficulties in life, for we learn through trials. But He is not angry; He has a covenant with you, and trials are part of that covenant. Trials are so you may come to know Him better, love Him more, and detach from the things of this world, fixing your eyes on heaven, where your true home and treasure lie.

When in prayer meetings we ask God to heal you because you are sick, we know that this, in light of the new covenant, does not mean He is angry with you. Do you know why? Because His wrath was poured out on the One who represented you on the cross, something not true in the old covenant. Therefore this new covenant brings peace and security to the believer in Jesus, because this covenant, whose clauses we have seen today, was signed by God Himself. Will He keep it? Of course He will keep it, since He signed it—mind you—in the blood of His own Son on a cross!

I conclude:
If anyone here today is not part of God’s people (a people with whom God has sealed a covenant for their good; a people who are joyful because they know He is their God and they are His people; a people who sometimes stumble along the way but rise again by the power of the Spirit in their hearts), God says to you: Today may be the day I choose to make a covenant with you, to bring you out of Egypt, lead you with wisdom through the wilderness until you cross the Jordan, and bring you safely into Canaan.

If you wish to become part of God’s people, you need only acknowledge your spiritual misery, repent of the sins that arise from that misery, and accept this new covenant that was already signed on the cross for the forgiveness of your sins and all your iniquities. God offers you today all His forgiveness and mercy so that you may join the covenant. But if you think it is unnecessary, if you think you can enter God’s presence by your own righteousness and opinion without being struck down, then, my friend, go ahead and see how far you get.

God would love to have you within His covenant, and so do we. Amen.
